<h4 class="container">The Lord of the Rings Book 3 opens with a very somber first chapter, as Boromir valiantly
    dies in battle for his people. Aragorn is disturbed, but realizes that the Fellowship must move
    on all the same. While in pursuit of the lost Hobbits and the orcs that captured them, the Three
    Hunters, as Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas are now known, bump into Men from Rohan. The men
    turn out to have information about the Hobbits and become allies of the humble Fellowship.
    Pippin and Merry are kept company by the Uruk-Hai, an especially unfriendly band of orcs.
    During a dispute between the different orc tribes represented, the poor Hobbits are able to
    make a narrow escape into the Forest of Fangorn where they meet a new friend, Treebeard.
    Treebeard turns out to be an Ent, whose real name is Fangorn. The Hobbits and Treebeard
    exchange stories, and come up with a plan to stop Saruman. Before Aragorn and his allies
    reach the Hobbits, they become spooked by a white ghost-like figure, who turns out to be
    Gandalf. The Fellowship moves on and partners with the Men of Rohan in the Battle of Helm’s
    Deep. There the Wild Men surrender to the Men of Rohan and the orcs flee. The Fellowship
    now makes its way to Isengard, and upon arrival, spot Merry and Pippin. They are reunited and
    join forces against Saruman. Gandalf takes a select amount of people to visit Saruman, hoping
    that he will surrender once and for all. The conversation proved to be practically worthless,
    except for Gandalf successfully breaking Saruman’s staff thereby greatly weakening his power.
    Pippin also acquired Saruman’s palantiri: a special stone that has allowed him to connect with
    Sauron. Pippin regretfully looks into the stone, and is frightened by what he sees. Gandalf and
    Pippin are now en route to Minas Tirith, where they hope to find some answers for the next
    part of their mission “before the seas of war surround it.”</h4>
